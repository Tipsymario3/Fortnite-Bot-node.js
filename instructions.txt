make a new epic games account for your bot

adjust everything else in there to whatever you want!
also extract the node_modules.zip file (drag the folder inside into your bot folder)
then to run it
send a friend request to the bot on your actual account
then while fortnite is open, open a command prompt in your bot folder (shift right click)
and type "node bot1.js" or whatever you called the file instead of bot1.js
then wait for it to load everything
then invite the bot to your party it will join automatically
now whisper to it, and say help
it will list commands that you can use.
some emotes skins and backblings you can use are in the files emote.txt backbling.txt and skin.txt but you can find more
